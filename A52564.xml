            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I do not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle glory in the honour of your Friendſhip, and that in the peruſal of theſe Papers you have been pleaſed to give them a valuation. I do now with more than ordinary aſſurance let them ſee light, ſince influenced by your favour, and warranted by ſo true an underſtanding.</p>

               </gap>te age may ſeem leſs faſhionable: but the moſt unconcerned perſon, when he comes to make a retreat into himſelf, will leave to turn devotion into Ridicule, and find piety his beſt ſecurity. Heights of this nature are not within my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; what I have moſt, reached at hath been the gracefulness of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, otherwiſe unfit to approach your Lordſhip. I know no reaſon but that compoſures of this kind ſhould put on all the luſtre we can dreſs them with, to beget Inamoratos, ſince their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick beauty hath in this pore-blind world ſo little attraction.</p>
            <p>My Lord, 'tis uſual in Dedications to celebrate the perſons we addreſs to; but your Lorſhip hath ſo often drawn your ſelf to the life, that a rude Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil would ſeem but to disfigure the fair Lineaments your inimitable hand hath faſhioned. To enumerate your Lordſhips perfections were too

Beſides (but by paying your Lordſhip a fitting obſervance) I ſhould offend your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, of which you are a great example.

               <p>AN Elegant Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no illuſtration from the faint colours laid on by a rude hand. The Pencil of the greateſt Statiſt fits beſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61462:5"/>to beautifie the nobleſt actions. What nobler action, than to chalk out the intricate Labyrinth to an eternity of bliſs? A skilful Pilot he muſt needs be that ſteers through this <hi>Helleſpont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſure Lanthorn of the glorious Goſpel muſt be eminently placed, while we paſs this ſtreight, when ſo many with winged Sails make to the heavenly <hi>Ophir,</hi> yet for want of the true Card of God's illuminating ſpirit to direct them, or fainting by the way, when they croſs the line of perſecution, few make a rich return of their labour.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— Pauci quos aequus amavit</l>
                  <l>Jupiter, at que ardens evexit ad aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra virtus.</l>

               <p>None then ſo fit to keep ſteddy the erring World, as old <hi>Salomon,</hi> who had not only God (the Infallible Word) to dictate to him, while he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61462:5"/>drop'd this Precept, but the <hi>Firm</hi> of Heaven ſet to a Tranſcript of a full Series of Experience, from the riſing to the ſetting of his Age. He could in the livelieſt colours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate unto us the exorbitances of our Juvenile fervours, who had the Malady thereof as a Quotidian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Magus</hi> could alſo beſt ſtate the unwieldineſs of froſted Age to ring an hourly Devotion, when the Wheels and Maſter-ſprings are ruſty and out of order, and its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity to raze thoſe ſtrong Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications Satan (that ſubtle Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer) cunningly builds to annoy us; when he, who had wiſdom to an aſtoniſhing excellency, could not repulſe the temptations ſpun with the fingers of the ſofter Sex, but muſt, in ſcorn of the ever living God, go worſhip <hi>Aſhtoreth,</hi> the Goddeſs of the <hi>Sydonians.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That's the burden of his Song: all the reſt of the ſtrings are wound up to tune with this. Good God ſo diſpoſe our hearts and hands to beat the time, that our ſouls, with ſo ſweet an harmony, ſo Angelical a <hi>Diapaſon,</hi> may be raviſh'd into an heavenly extaſie.</p>
               <p>Before the glimmering ſpark of our devotion be abſolutely extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, he puts in this ſeaſonable <hi>Memento,</hi> as a bellows to blow it into a new flame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is the Antidote that cleanſeth and purifieth our blood, poyſon'd with the invenomd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of our ſins. Thoſe Seraphick thoughts are the pearled dews, Ambroſial ſhowrs, that water, and refreſh us, when we are almoſt dried up, and withered: Thoſe <hi>Arabian</hi> winds (rich in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61462:6"/>that fan and cool our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſcorch'd with the raging heat of luſt and concupiſcence. When the gaſtly viſage, haggiſh Ghoſt of ſin affrights us, one drop diſtill'd from this Alembick, and carefully thrown on the faces of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, preſently inſpirits thoſe parts, which before only wanted the decent ceremony of a Winding Sheet. When we are ſung aſleep with Satan's Lullabys, when, in the midnight of a beſotted Lethargy, he carries his dark Lanthorn to fire this train, here's the <hi>Curfue</hi> that rings the Alarm, that with full buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of repentant tears we may timely extinguiſh the ſpreading flames, before they lay hold on the rotten buildings of our ſouls.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They who went to the Cave of <hi>Trophonius,</hi> to conſult the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, drank of two Rivers; <hi>Lethe</hi> at the entring in, <hi>Mnemoſyne</hi> at the going forth; that, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61462:7"/>of the one, they might purge their thoughts of ſuch delectations, as they had given too free a Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to; by the other, enſhrine in their breaſts what that adored Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety deign'd them the knowledg of. So when we make our Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Heaven, conſult that ſacred Oracle, we muſt not only memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze him, as the great Architect of the Univerſe, as God from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, but we muſt clear our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of all Dregs and Lees, the iſſue of our foul Impieties, of ſuch poyſonous Cates as diſcolour the eaſie tinctur'd complexion of our ſouls, with this cooling <hi>Julip</hi> put out the fire of our Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, with this <hi>Opiate</hi> deaden and ſtupifie our enraged affections.</p>
               <p>Good and evil, like fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have repugnant qualities, will not body together, but like an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, break.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How then can we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61462:7"/>our Creatour as a pure Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but we muſt abominate our own beaſtiality? How can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him as a juſt Judge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trembling at the Bar of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and putting in the merits of our Saviour, as our ſureſt Plea? Or take in <hi>Ideas</hi> of an all-ſeeing eye, without ranſacking the inmoſt Cells, and <hi>Meanders</hi> of our hearts, for the caſting out thoſe Devils, thoſe Impieties that have lain ſo long leiger? They muſt be thus exorcis'd before we can faſhion an entertainment, garniſh the beſt lodgings in our ſouls, give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful audience to thoſe tutelary Angels, to that <hi>Legatus à latere,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus himſelf.</p>

Our afflictions are no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations for ſins paſt, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given us as a makebate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and our indeered amours, to divorce us from the gayeties, and Utopian felicities of this deceivable world, which (like the Panther) pleaſes at diſtance with a perfum'd breath, but in their embraces mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us.</p>

Let us take our riſe from our entrance on this ſtage of life to the ſhutting up our laſt Cataſtrophe, and we ſhall appear Actors in one continued Tragoedy. No ſooner bolt we out of the womb (for we come head-long into the world, which ſhews our giddineſs and innate love to it) but we find an entertainment ſo cold, that we are fain to warm us with our own tears, and our ability ſo faint, ſo uſeleſs to adminiſter relief to our crying neceſſities, that our little Organs are preſently ſounded to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore a neceſſary aid, our legs too weak to underprop the ſmall burden of our bodyes, our hands not ſtrong enough to reach us ſuſtenance; and ſhe that landed us in this vale of miſery could not keep us from going aſſoon out of it, if the arms of a ſtranger did not reprieve us from the grave. All that time we are

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Torrid Zone of our age, in theſe diſtempering dog-dayes, our deſires are ſo exorbitant, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo diſproportionable to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of reaſon, that while wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through innumerable Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of care and trouble, truſting to the Clue of our own fanatick ſpinning, we loſe our ſelves, and ſeldom attain to that our betraying fancy reach'd at. What though

So that this florid part of our life, if compar'd to the other extreams of age, appears to you at firſt with as great a difference, as the Sun in its pride to a day of clouds. Yet upon a due calculation we have as many Halcyonian dayes under either Polar Star, as under the Eccliptick of our youth.</p>

               <p>Seeing then the ſorrows of this life are the trueſt glaſſes to dreſs our ſelves in, though they are burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſes yet let us look ſtedfaſtly on them, and there ſhall we behold Tyara's, and ſcepters, prepared for us.

Let us not therefore think we are hardly dealt withal, becauſe God would not remit any thing of a due debt, but forbear giving up our Verdict, till we ſweeten our cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with the enſuing Mercies, which is that that next preſents it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="15">15. As the Mercies of God are above all his Works; ſo is this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his, in ſacrificing his only Son, Paramount above all his other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. For ſince Hecatombs of Beaſts could not appeaſe the wrath of God, but that we muſt enjoy the blackneſs of Hell for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, he freely beſtowed on us his

               <p n="16">16. Friendſhip is never ſo truly beautified, at no time ſo gorgeouſly ſet forth, as when, like a ready Handmaid, it waits, upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt indigency. God was, and is, that true Friend to us. He ſaw how near we ſate to the Margent of Hell, how the Devil ſtood in Ambuſcado with dilated Arms, ready upon our firſt tripping to lay hold on us, our own imbecillity to reſiſt: the Attack; then ſent he one that would not be foiled, ſhould reſcue us out of the Regions of Darkneſs, though with the unavoidable loſs of his own moſt precious Blood. Ungrateful
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61462:69"/>Man, though he hath defaced the Image of his Maker, diſrobed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all his Glories, yet would not God that he ſhould die eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is moſt eminently ſeen in this his one mercy.</p>
               <p>As it was a mercy in God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way ſatisfied for oui Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo was it as great a mercy in Chriſt to lay down his life: for he did it ſpontaneouſly, and without compulſion; his Paſſion being wholly in compaſſion to thoſe,</p>
               <q>Qui mortem inſonti poſſent imponere Chriſto.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> 1. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I have power to lay down my life, &amp; I have power to take it up again:</hi> That he that was God, and is God, ſhould die, is man's wonder: but that he, who could draw forth more than twelve Legions of Angels in warlike Equipage to his Reſcue (when one
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61462:70"/>ſingle Angle proved ſufficient to ſlay one hundred and eighty five thouſand armed Men in one night) would die moſt readily, lay down his life, rears that wonder a degree higher. But that this Son of God (whoſe Soul was ſo Cryſtalline, whoſe whole life more innocent than the Seraphical thoughts of expiring Saints) would prodigally pour forth his moſt precious Blood to bath and cleanſe our Leproſie, is an exaltation of that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſhall be upon record, as an high peice of merit, if one man lay down the Treaſures of his own life to cancel the exacted debt of of his Friend.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Subeuntem fata mariti</l>

                  <hi>Alceſtes</hi> reprieved her Husband <hi>Admetus</hi> with the loſs of her own life. <hi>Maecenas,</hi> a noble <hi>Theban,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61462:70"/>embraced death to reſtore life to his Captive Country. <hi>Calphurnia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Marius,</hi> was by him ſacrificed in the <hi>Cimbrick</hi> War. Hiſtory is replete with blazoning Graecian and Roman Worthies, who have diſvalued their own lives, when in competition with the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour of their Country. This had a limitation to their Friends, to their diſtreſſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet it entitled them to be ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hallowed <hi>Pantheon,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled among the Gods, to have Tombs and Statues, built to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their memory to futurity. But Chriſt's love was univerſal, it had the eſſential property of good, it was <hi>ſui diffuſivum,</hi> it extended to the whole Univerſe, to thoſe that deſpitefully uſed him. In the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of his Paſſion, in the throws of his moſt compungent ſufferings, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi> There could be no ends in Chriſt,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61462:71"/>no accumulating of Glories, in whom dwelt the Fulneſs of the God-head bodily.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The inſuperable and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of Chriſt is every where legible and conſpicuous. Let us faſhion returns of Gratitude in the greater Odium to our Deviations, that coſt him ſo many pains, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorrows; making that pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> our own, <hi>Nolo vivere ſine vulnere, cùm te video vulneratum:</hi> As long as we hear thy Wounds, as ſo many Mouths, crying out upon the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of our Aberrations, we will not live without a throbbing Soul, a wounded Spirit. He had days of Humiliation for our Feſtivals, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for our rejoycing; drank Vinegar mingled with Gall for our Carouſing; for our Purple and fine Linnen he wore a Robe of Mockery, and that ſpat on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; was ſcourged for our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonizing;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61462:71"/>macerated his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to pull down the excreſſency of ours, over-grown with a reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Luxury; crowned with Thorns to obtain for us a Crown of Righteouſneſs, that he might throw to us the Donatives of Everlaſting Life. And after all this (as if his Endearedneſs to us had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto unexpreſſive) aſcended the Croſs, that by that Ladder we may ſcale Heaven, and for our prize have the Fellowſhip of Saints and Angels for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus we have ſeen God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Mercy run parallel. His juſtice muſt keep us to that ſevere awe, and perfect Obedience, that preſumption get no footing in our hearts; not ſo much as an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, whereby it may at any time ſurpriſe the main Fort. His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy muſt teach us not to deſpair of his ſeaſonable relieving us; though our Sins are the black Curtain
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61462:72"/>drawn between the light of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; Countenance and us, ſo that we are almoſt dried up, and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet, at, the leaſt appearance of our Humiliation, he will ſhed ſome Gleams, dart a Ray of Favour upon our drooping Souls.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An abuſed patience amongſt moſt men transforms it ſelf into a fiery indignation. What greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for God to deſtroy the intereſt we have in his favour, than our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and ingratitude. The Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites after they had once received from the hand of God Livery and Seizin of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by that had a confirmation of the validity of his Promiſes, they ſo ſoon forgot the exuberant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Lord, that he preſently ſeiſed on their large Charter of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and gave them into the hands of Tyrants, Chriſt when he had once peiced the rich Robes of the Deity to the rags of fleſh,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61462:72"/>ſoon found us ſick even to death, our wounds gangreen'd, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could reſtore them but his own Blood. <hi>Medicabile Nardum,</hi> rich Spikenard, precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he ſearched into our ſores, wiped off thoſe venemous polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we had attracted from the Loins of our firſt Parents, made us ſound men, left us his Antidotes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to continue ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But we muſt not like an over-confident Prodigal, who hath his firſt Debts ſtrook off from his Friends hopeful amendment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his unthriftineſs, preſuming to find their favour as prolifical as at firſt. <hi>Debet amor laeſus iraſci.</hi> Love once abuſed changes its ſmiles into frowns.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God will not be mocked; he hath a Rod of Iron in his Hand, which he will not always brandiſh over us, but when we provoke his wrath he will ſtrike home. <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61462:73"/>irae gravitate ſupplicii com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſabit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Lactantius.</hi>) Though God doth not preſent execution, yet when he is pleaſed to ſcourge us, he will recompenſe the ſlowneſs with the weight and grievouſneſs of our Chaſtiſements.</p>
               <p>Then when God is angry who can ſtand before his wrath, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the fierceneſs of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the Rocks are broken by him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe the Almighty hath hitherto given us a Life-Guard of Angels, that therefore he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſame protection to us (however we demean our ſelves) is an argument built wholly upon fallacy. The diſtance is many times great betwixt his Will and Power. 'Twere eaſie for God to make the Black Guard of Satan ſplendid Courtiers in Heaven, tranſplant all the fiery Legions of Hell into Parar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61462:73"/>hallow and ſanctifie all their Profanations, transforming them into glorious Angels of Light, and inſtead of howling and ſhrieking, make them perfect Choriſters to ſing Anthems in the Celeſtial Quire. But that God will have his juſtice go an even pace with his mercy; they to be tormentors for ſinning, we to be tormented by them for offending.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But let it not be with us as in unſound Bodies, the expelling of one Diſeaſe the making room for another, which may be as obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as the firſt; inſtead of a too confident relying upon the mercies of God, and our own worthineſs, to fall upon its contrary evil, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of the ſufficiency of his promiſes. From the laſt, a Rock equally as dangerous as the firſt, ſhould be our care to waft our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Veſſels, when we have almoſt ſteered into ſafe Harbour.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61462:74"/>We cannot figure any thing of the inward and diſtant Lights of the upper Region, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a <hi>Teleſcope.</hi> But God, with a Glance ſwifter than Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, darts through all the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves of our pretenſions ſooner than thought; threds the Maze and Labyrinths of all our Hearts: Then muſt he needs give a <hi>verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dixiſti</hi> to <hi>Moſes, Our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are evil, and that continually.</hi> Aſſoon as we ſhake off the Fetters of the Womb we are froward, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at our Maker's dealing with us, who might have moulded us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Monſters. As ſoon as we draw breath we draw in ſin, and that with Greedineſs. But let not this anatomizing our contagious Souls ſtartle us, or fill us with conceit, that therefore we ſhall utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſh; for if we were deſtined to damnation, then were our Creation no happineſs, but a curſe.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:61462:74"/>9. If we timely take up, God will let light into that gloomy dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that invelops us, diſperſe thoſe full ſwoln Clouds of his Wrath, that they break not on us. He is not an inexorable Judge: his ſtock of mercy is as replete as ours of ſins. The Thief on the Croſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his repentance till the laſt moment (when we are ſure he had not time to make long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) yet did out-run many who all their life rode poſt to Heaven, and gave in his <hi>Benè diſceſſit</hi> the ſame day the Son of God entred into his Glory. If after all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brabam</hi> could have found out but ten righteous perſons in thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Cities, God would have ſtopped the Viols of his Wrath from being, poured out upon them. A ſtrange diſcouraging Lottery, where ſo many thouſand Blanks may be drawn, before the Hand of God
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61462:75"/>can light upon one prize. Here might we enumerate the mercies of God, and for want of numbers leave them numberleſs. Sure this would have more puzzled <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>'s Arithmetick, than the Sands of the Sea he proudly vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he could give a number to.</p>
               <p n="10">10. 'Twas a mercy in God to midwife us from the dark Priſon of the Womb, which otherwiſe would have been to us a putrid Grave. 'Twas a greater mercy in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us till we arrive at a ripeneſs of Knowledge, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our admirable making, with the wonderful Architecture of the Univerſe. But a greater mercy than that is the poſſeſſing our Souls with the ſaving knowledge of his Word, which is a Lantern to our Feet, and ſerves as a Pale, and Fence, to keep in the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mind of man from breaking out into all Enormities. Where,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61462:75"/>for our greater Regulement, we may ſee as clear, as if painted by a Sun-beam, the Sufferings of the Primitive Saints, and God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them to hold out the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict to the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without Apoſtacy; and likewiſe his Juſtice ſeverely executed on thoſe, that preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpurn at his Ordinances, and deſpiſe his rich mercies.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But his mercy of mercies, and greateſt of all mercies, is, that of ſending his only Son, who was equal to the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt in Majeſty and Honour, to have ſorrow, ſuch a ſorrow as ſhould make him ſo dolorouſly complain to all thoſe that paſſed by. To die, to die ſuch a death as ſhould make him ſo paſſionately cry out to his Father, as if he had ſuffered the height of God's Anger (his Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction) and all to exorciſe us of ſin, and Satan; ranſom us out of a Land darker than darkneſs it ſelf,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61462:76"/>that we may be elated into the higheſt Heaven, where we ſhall be as far above the Sphere the Sun moves in, as we are now below it.</p>

               <p>'TIs a Canon drawn up in the Colledge of Heaven, that through the Ordeal Fires of Adverſity the Saints enter the Regions of Bleſſedneſs. 'Tis fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied

               <p n="14">14. We muſt ſcale theſe rugged <hi>Alpes</hi> before we make our <hi>Intrado</hi> into the <hi>Campania</hi> of future Glory.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61462:77"/>Race is run, they have finiſhed their Tragedy with a glorious <hi>Exit,</hi> with the <hi>Plaudite</hi> God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>Some ſay the Lilies have no other Seed than their own Tears. We are ſure the Church hath no better Seed than the Blood of her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.

Here is the true Sword Salve which both wounds and heals. O lovely Sore, when the Heavenly <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> puts on the Plaiſter: O happy wound, that worketh ſo glorious a reſtoration.

               <p>Philoſophy tells us, that the worlds chief materials are Food and Raiment, the reſt is <hi>Nugatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um quiddam,</hi> whole abſence may be diſpenſed withal; and therefore, if the choſen of God want the Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies of an exuberant Fortune, we cannot ſay their life is levened with ſorrow and diſcomfort.</p>

'Tis not the thing it ſelf that hath any intrinſecal worth to ennoble our condition, but our manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, the value we ſet on it. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermites Coat was as gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous in his Eye, as if veſted with a <hi>Perſian</hi> Robe. And <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> Locuſts and wild Honey taſted as ſweetly, as if he had feaſted at the Table of <hi>Apicius</hi> or <hi>Lucullus.

Let our condition be never ſo abject, ſo neceſſitous, we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to obnubilate the Sun of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the leaſt interpoſition of diſtruſt: for Heavens great Almoner many times gives us a meaſure brim full, pours out the over-flowings of his Love, and that when all humane help is at a loſs, and impoſſibility of ſelf-preſervation. Where could the Iſraelites have found out mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61462:80"/>for the cutting out new Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their forty years ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Wilderneſs, if God had not miraculouſly minded their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation? Sure no Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo laſting as that which this great Architect faſhions with his own hands: the Ground was too rude and churliſh to give Viands to ſo many Gueſts, yet the Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt</hi> could not equal the Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are in that barren Soil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sure the Banquet muſt be rich and bountiful, when this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Diſpenſator furniſhes the Table with Cates, fetched out of the Store-Houſe of Heaven.

               <p>We have not yet ſeen any Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon Faces to affright us, and though we are led into darker Rooms, yet the Damps will not be ſo great as to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61462:80"/>make our Tapers burn blew. To be ſentenced to the <hi>Athenian Oſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,</hi> denyed to breath the Air that ſuckled us, torn from the ſociety of Friends and Acquaintance, ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dear Embraces of an indulgent Wife, to hear the Cries and Heart-breakings of a tender Off-ſpring, or, like diſconſolate <hi>Niobe,</hi> ſee them ſlain in our own ſight. We might think this to be calculated for the Meridian of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; yet it is a Grief that may be very well ſupported with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of what is yet left us. And if this be not Cordial O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative enough, conſider that in Heaven we ſhall not be erratick, but Stars fixed in the Firmament of Glory; not irradiated with a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed luſtre, but perpetually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with the preſence of God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Plato</hi> never reckoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſtitute of Company as long

They may eraſe our Palaces, diſparkle our riches, ſtrip us of all the world calls beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, becauſe we are here but Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at will; but that which we hold by a ſecond life is <hi>a Building not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> They may dilacerate our Bodies with unaccuſtomed Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, undreſs them of natures chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt imbelliſhments, yet they cannot diſrobe our Conſciences of their white Veſtments, extinguiſh thoſe bright flames which (like <hi>Elias</hi>'s Chariot) coaches us up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If they baniſh me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Brutus</hi>) <hi>they cannot forbid to carry with me my Vertues.</hi> They are Crown-Jewels that muſt not be fingered,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61462:81"/>no ravenous hand may embezzle. Though Detraction blurs our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with her ſowr Breath, makes putrid the ſweet Ointment of a good name; though our <hi>Statuas</hi> are thrown out of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and hung up by the Heels in the <hi>Forum;</hi> though our names are blotted out of their Records and Annals of fame, regiſtred only with ſcorn and imbaſement, God permits it, that from this obſcurity, out of this lowneſs of Fortune, he may do himſelf the more honour, ſhew the excellency of his power by mounting us on a higher Throne, drawing the Rays of our Glory to a brighter Luſtre. Hiſtorians eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſhew us many brave men, as well Heathens as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (who had no other fault but too much merited of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) that have been paid with ſcorn and ingratitude, nay, with Proſcription; and afterwards, with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61462:82"/>the conſent &amp; applauſe of thoſe very Perſecuters, have thrown off the Mantles and Coverings of Darkneſs and Obſcurity, and like the Sun af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an interpoſition, appeared all Glorious.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God ſeldom remunerates his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants here with a temporary felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Some indeed have been crown'd with Roſe-Buds, have let no Flower of the Spring paſs by them. Though <hi>Mordecai,</hi> a Captive, was inveſted with the Royal Robes, and rode up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King's Horſe, yet others have gone on foot, and not a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gourd to refreſh them, but ſo as he comforts and keeps vivid the Vitals with his Spirits and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, diſtilled through that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Limbeck, <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle: <hi>We may be troubled on every ſide, but not diſtreſſed, perplexed, but not in deſpair, perſecuted, but not forſaken.</hi> God hath Balſom for every Wound, a Plaiſter for every Sore, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61462:82"/>though he dreſs it not while it is green and freſh, yet he will make his applications before it feſter.</p>
               <p>What though God ſuffer an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner to lay violent hands upon thee, he cannot go a ſtep beyond death; he does but antidate the work of a Diſeaſe, the difference only is, a nefarious hand preſently ſtorms the body, and a malady takes it in by a longer Siege: few drop like a waſted Taper in the Socket, but ſome violent wind puts it out, ſome ſharp Diſeaſe is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſher, and the Conflicts and Colluctations that ſuch have with death adequate the throws of a more haſty Tranſition. So that it matters not whether we die <hi>Sicca,</hi> or <hi>humida morte;</hi> whether we are burnt with a quick fire at the ſtake, or a lingring one of a Fever; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are thrown into the <hi>Tiber,</hi> or drowned at home with a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; whether ſtarved in a Priſon, or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61462:83"/>ſhrivelled in our Chamber with a Conſumption.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Since God hath a Statute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Bodies, <hi>It being appointed for all men once to die:</hi> and that we cannot be removed from our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Life but by death, then the ſhorteſt way muſt needs be the beſt. 'Tis a poor thrift to put a Save-all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Farthing Candle, to be angry becauſe the thred of nature is broken before ſhe has time to wind off the whole bottom. Though the eye of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not dim, nor his natural force abated, yet when God bade him, <hi>Go up and die,</hi> he readily quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his own command, went up to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and died. The Primitive Chriſtians ſet ſo great an eſtimate upon the days of their death, that they called them <hi>Nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> Then they only began their <hi>Epocha</hi> of living: the world was but before in labour with them, and death was the Midwife to give them a Nativity.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:61462:83"/>8. Certainly could we but hear the Tranſports of a refined Soul ſinging an <hi>Obiit</hi> to the world, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring her Heavenly <hi>Viaticum,</hi> it would have a ſtrange charm, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake our Poppy Souls, and infuſe into them raptures of joy and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation unexpreſſive; or if fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the Model of that Philoſopher, who would have a Window in the Breaſt of every man, we might ſee a ſtrange Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity within him, not a Cloud in that Hemiſphere. What more lovely than the wounds of <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> (though drawn with a rugged Pencil)? Thoſe feathered Arrows<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged him for an Heavenly Flight. Does not a Martyr amidſt his Flames ſhew like the Sun encircled with Rays of Glory? And S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> when brought before the Council, appeared not with pallor &amp; dejection (like a Malefactor that looks half executed before the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61462:84"/>doom be paſt) but ſo Seraphical, that the Judges ſaw his face, as though it had been the face of an Angel. When a Saint hath been mounting a Scaffold, have we not been big with conceit by thoſe few Stairs he was aſcending a Throne; that it was his <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder that railed him up to Heaven?</p>
               <p n="9">9. He muſt needs make a boon Voyage, that in ſo little a time is ſet on the ſhore of eternity, with ſo few ſteps is carried from earth to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Let not then any thing ſtartle us, though vizarded with loathſomneſs and deformity, nor be terrified, though we change life for death (with that brave Theban <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi>) ſo the Victory may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. It is God's care (and who would not almoſt love his Diſeaſe for ſuch a Phyſician (many times to uſe Corroſives to the Body, that the Soul may have her Lenitives;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61462:84"/>puniſh the worſer part, that the better may be preſerved. To a mortal man there can be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of evil, man himſelf hath but a ſhort period; his life compared to things of the leaſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And yet they that acted the moſt tragical parts (no doubt) had ſome Interludes and Receſſes. It was not long that <hi>Joſeph</hi> lay in priſon, nor <hi>Job</hi> on the Dunghil, nor <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the Dungeon.

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. It is againſt the Rules of a Tragedy to have every Scene filled with Blood ſhed and Slaughter. A ſtrange diſtempered Seaſon if the Heavens ſhould continually be hung with black; as ſtrange if we always ſate in darkneſs, that the Sun did not ſometimes peep through our cloud of Adverſity. Though
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61462:85"/>it enlighten not the whole Body, yet it may guild the Fringes and Borders of it; gives us, though not a glorious light, yet ſufficient to keep our dying ſpark alive. But againſt all partiality, it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtrangely ſhort, if compared to the never terminating pains of the Fiends below, where the Worm never dieth, nor the Fire ever goeth out. It is obſerved by <hi>Boetius,</hi> That a <hi>punctum</hi> of time, and ten thouſand years hold better proportion than ſo many years, and that endleſs thing Eternity. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum, aeternum, quanta, haec dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, quanta!</hi> How much horrour and amazement ſhould the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it bring to them that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a preſent felicity, a few tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Glimmerings, ſo much hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and confuſion; where they ſhall ſpend <hi>morientem vitam,</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dying, and yet never die; not one drop of Water ſhall be caſt

Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is the cry of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Is it not then better to be caſt down with ſorrow for ſin, than to be ſunk ſo low, that we never riſe again; to be clouded for a while, than over-caſt for ever? <hi>Melior eſt modica amaritudo in fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus, quàm aeternum tormentum in viſceribus:</hi> It is better to chew a little Gaul in our mouths; than to have Gripings in our Bowels, and Excoriations in our Souls, and that for ever: to drink a Jill of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, than to be perpetually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with the Cup of his fiery Indignation: to endure the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61462:86"/>of a night, for the joy that cometh in the morning; a day that ſhall never be benighted, a day that ſhall not have ſo much as a Cloud to veil or curtain the Saints happineſs.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It was anſwered by that famed Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> (when <hi>Apollonius</hi> deſired admiſſion for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> men eminently qualified) <hi>My Gates ſtand always open to Philoſophers, but my very Breaſt is open to</hi> Apollonius. So the Gates of that Palace Royal of Heaven, that ſure City of Refuge, are never ſhut againſt ſuch as are beaten on the Anvil of Affliction for righteouſneſs ſake. But God receives theſe to a greater endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſtretches their natures wider to receive a fuller meaſure of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, erects their Throne with more refined Gold, ſets richer Jewels in their Crown, that ennoble their ſuffering with Patience and Glory
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61462:86"/>in their Tribulation. Patience, it fans the holy fires of Love, throws perfumes into the flame, ſnuffs our Lamp, and makes it burn with a brighter clarity; like the Chymiſts Elixir, it turns all into incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gold, the Touchſtone by which God tries his people whether they be Gold or a baſer Metal.</p>
               <p n="13">13.

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61462:87"/>He that goeth to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and ſeeth Martyrs and Malefactors ſent to the immortality of another world, may eaſily make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, who ſuffers for demerit, and who for a good conſcience. The one ſings in his flames, the other howls; the one reproaches the Executioner, the other thanks him, and with that Proto-Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> prays for him; the one, like a ſpent Meteor, ſtinks in his Socket, the other (like Aromatick Torches) perfumes the Air with odoriferous Evaporations, or a ſetting Sun that leaves an impreſſion of Glory on the Neighbouring Clouds.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61462:88"/>Myriads of Saints marched in the van, and dared their Enemies to an Execution, ſhall it ſtartle us to bring up the rear? No Victory without fighting, no Crown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Victory. We may be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at the Olympick Games, carry a Crown to adorn anothers Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, but never wreath our own Brows, unleſs we get the Garland with ſtriving. And who will not enter the Liſts, when he is ſure to carry away the prize? For God, with his Militia of Angels, attends the Combat, and enhaunceth the price of their Virtue, according to the vigorouſneſs of the temptation they grapple with. If ſuch had not their exemption from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an angry God, whom the Lord hath ſtyled, <hi>A man after his own hearty, the ſignet of his right hand, the friend of God, his Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, his Building</hi> (expreſſions of a ſtrange endearedneſs) can
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61462:88"/>we, that are but Shrubs and Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, think to have merited more of lenity than thoſe Oaks of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> thoſe Cedars of <hi>Lebanon;</hi> thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums of Piety and Godlineſs, that our ſervices are of an higher ſtrain than the Apoſtles and primitive Saints, and therefore he ſhould lay his ſtrokes the gentler on us.</p>

Believe it, we have dipped our Sins in a far deeper Die, made them as red as Scarlet, rivalled the greateſt Offender, and therefore our ſuffering can never make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Oblation. If God did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually flaſh his Lightnings, dart his Thunder-bolts, and knot his Rods (like the Whips of the Furies) with Serpents and Scorpions, yet the diſproportion muſt be ſtrangely great betwixt a finite ſuffering, and an infinite Majeſty offended. 'Tis of ſingular advantage and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to us in this War-fare, that Chriſt underwent the fame

               <p>L. 1 .It was a comfort to dying <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that he received his death from the great <hi>Aeneas.</hi> It matters not how many ſtripes we receive, how deep the wound, how diſconſolate the Soul, ſince it is a Saviour that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, who carries healing under his Wings: ſo much Blood and Sweat, ſo many Sighs and Sobs ſhall not become fruitleſs; but he will ſee tho Work of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption perfected. We are wounded, but that good <hi>Samaritan</hi> will have compaſſion, bind up our Sores, and pour Oil and Spikenard on them, that can ſettle and compoſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61462:89"/>a diſtempered and ſadded Soul, and ſparkle our Countenance, as if we were putting on the Royal Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the morning of our Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: <hi>Dum dat verbera oſtendit ubera.</hi> God never bruiſes us, but he hath a Plaiſter ready ſpread, pearled Cordials to fetch back a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting life. 'Tis ſaid the Stork lets out the corrupt Blood of her young ones, and then acts the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon's part, cloſing up the Wound with her Tongue. <hi>Thy Rod, and thy Staff, they comfort me;</hi> both like loving Correlates attend each other.</p>

It is a very great advance to a Cure, when our fancy builds a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the means and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons us'd by our Phyſician will be prevalent to a repelling the Diſeaſe; then we yield our Bodies wholly to his diſpoſal, and never diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will phlebotomize, or uſe ſtrong Purgations; whether he

               <p>Sure thoſe Laws of the Romans (like <hi>Draco</hi>'s) ſhould have been writ in bloody Characters, where they inveſted the Parents with the power of life and death of their Wives and Children. <hi>Fulvius</hi> had not the denomination of cruel in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing execution upon his Son for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federating with <hi>Catiline.</hi> And <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> was thought rather favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than a ſevere Juſticer, when he went no higher than to make his Son <hi>Syllanus</hi> a perpetual exile.</p>

Our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father that faſhioned us may impoſe what Laws his divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thinketh beſt; but if he wounds his Servants, 'tis to heal them; if he takes away a temporary life, 'tis to haſten them to an eternal one.</p>

                  <hi>Magni beneficii eſt indicium;</hi> When God ſeems to disfavour us, then are we in higheſt favour; and we make the neareſt approaches to him, when in the eyes of the world we ſeem to be at the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

So we muſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the glaring luſtre of the World before we can truly diſcern Heaven, and the radiancy of its

The Aſtronomers beſt poſture is to lie proſtrate on the Ground. When we are thrown on our Back, humbled and brought low, then we beſt behold God's Immenſity, and our own impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Earth that hath endured the Summers Heat, and Winters cold, cut with the Plow, and crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Harrow, is beſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated to receive her Seed, and make a grateful return to her Benefactor.

               <p>After we have been thruſt into the Forge of Perſecution, we are then malleable, eaſieſt to be ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered out. God ſets his ſtamp, coins us for Glory, when melted in

Thunder ſcatters and diſparkles ill boding exhalations, cleers the Air of all peſtilent and malevolent humours: God thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by affliction, breaks the racks of ſin, and ſcatters thoſe foul Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors that are engendring in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of our Souls. Spikenard, precious Ointment, and ſweet Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſavours more that the hand ſcatters and throws about, than when ſealed up in their Incloſures of Cryſtal.

If Corruption can put on ſuch charm, how bright ſhall we ſhine, when quickened with Celeſtial Fire; though inveſted with the ſame fleſh, yet ſpun to a finer Thread; though kneaded of the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61462:100"/>yet finer ſearſed, caſt in a fairer mold: our Bodies ſhall be clarified into Soul-Matter, and our Souls flame out with the Fires of a Divinity. No leſs than an Apoſtle aſſures us, <hi>We ſhall be made partakers of the divine nature;</hi> be ſo rarified, ſo ſpiritualized, have (as the Schoolmen venture to call it) an <hi>Identification</hi> with God in the ſtate of Bliſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here we have a Film, a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract in the eye, that Luminary, our underſtanding clouded with a Cimmerian Darkneſs; at beſt we ſee but in <hi>Aenigmate,</hi> darkly, or like things we behold in the Water, that appear with crooked and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted forms. But when that great Oculiſt of Heaven unſeals the eyes of our underſtanding, ſhews us <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> thoſe abſtracted ſpeculations, which are now inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and paſt finding out, ſhall then be as plainly figured, as if writ with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61462:100"/>a Sun-beam, and we ſhall behold the inſide of things with a clearer perſpicuity, than we do now their outſide or colours. There we ſhall underſtand why the ſin of one man ſhould be the ſin of every man; why God would not cancel the Worlds Obligation without that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Blood of his dear Son, when he might have ſatisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a meaner Sacrifice, or taken away the cauſe by denying the Tempter acceſs into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; ſhew how the world was made, whether by a fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms, as our Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Philoſophy have it; how the earth hangs upon nothing; how <hi>Moſes</hi> did all his wonders in <hi>Egypt;</hi> unriddle the Sacred Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Deity, and thoſe inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable knots of Divinity, which have unſheathed ſo many Swords, cauſed ſuch Claſhes and Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhall be all enodated, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61462:101"/>as in a Mirrour to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here we may ſtand on Tiptoe, look into the Elyzian Fields through the proſpective of Faith, but we view them at a great diſtance, and commonly we have weak Beams, and an unſteddy hand, but there thoſe faint means will become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: God will pull off his Mask, throw aſide every <hi>Umbrella,</hi> and give us a patefaction of all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> ſparkled with the Beauties of Chriſt's Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, and the Apoſtles were ſhewed the gorgeous Apparel they ſhould be decked with hereafter: no wonder if <hi>Peter</hi> deſired there to fix their Tabernacles. If ſuch a Stage as Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> can preſent a Scene ſo richly dreſſed, when a few Saints deſcend and traverſe it; how illuſtrious will the ſight be, when we ſee the Great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and Myriads of Angels, <hi>pleno orbe,</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61462:101"/>in their full Glory. We ſhall not only ſee theſe Tranſcendencies, but be that which admits of no emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing, adapted, made congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſympathetick with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Perfections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Stars have their Malevolent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the brighter Luminaries their Spots, and the moſt ſplendid Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is not every where tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. But in Heaven there are no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata's, the beatified Saints cannot contract the leaſt ſtain. No unclean thing enters into thoſe Holy Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, breath nothing but the ſweets of love, have ſuch a fulneſs of every delicious thing, that there can be no addition: for, if there could be any increment or decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then there were no perfection. <hi>Ibi vita ſine morte, veritas ſine errore, felicitas ſine perturbatione,</hi> all things ſublimated to the moſt extaſied puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; that without any change, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance, no night but an endleſs day.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:61462:102"/>5. Things are beſt illuſtrated by their Contraries. The Northern Men, that are benighted for ſix Months together, ſalute the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Sun with a more exceeding joy, than they that face him every day. The Beauties of the Spring receive a better Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come after a ſtormy Winter. Reſt will be moſt joyous to thoſe who have undergone a troubleſome Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage. The clarity of Heaven will appear more lucid to them that ſate here in darkneſs. Take a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner out of a dark Dungeon, and ſet him before an unclouded Sun, and he ſhall not be able to make him a fixed Object. And what is the Radiancy of this Sun to the Son of God? This Spark to that glorious Diamond, this Daddock-wood, this Glow-worm to that Morning-Star? When God ſhall raiſe his Servants out of their Beds of Obſcurity, remove
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61462:102"/>them from the dark Chambers of the earth, and ſhew them the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Manſions above, they ſhall be like Cherubims, full of eyes, give and receive light, and nothing ſhall weaken, their improved Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, though millions of Suns ſhine in one Horizon in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of Glory. Theſe Suns ſhall never exhale an ungrateful Cloud to obſcure them, never be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to eclypſe each others light; their joys ſhall not be leven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the leaſt ſorrow. That clear Sky ſhall not contract the leaſt ſpot, and which is more, time ſhall never wrinkle them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. 'Tis a conceit of the Poets, that in <hi>Elyſium</hi> their Goblets were always full of <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia;</hi> and as they ſtill drank, their Cups were repleniſhed to an over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Saints have better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the Permanency of their Paradiſian Bliſs. <hi>Mutabimur in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61462:103"/>immutabilitatem:</hi> We ſhall be changed into an unchangeableneſs. Our Crowns ſhall continue the ſame ſplendor, our Robes the ſame Lillied Purity, our Palms the ſame Verdure and Fragrancy. Here we are in a continued fluxibility, have Springs and Palls, Summers and Winters, Droughts and Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But in our final Eſtate there is neither <hi>Efforeſcentia nec caneſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> no ebbing or flowing, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing of that Veſtal Fire; no falling of that Golden Leaf of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Glory. Becauſe our time is here ſhort, we cut it into ſhreds, reckon by Minutes, Hours and Days. But when we have once caſt Anchor in the Ocean of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>non eſt heri nec heſternum;</hi> there ſhall be no diſtinction of Days, no reckoning <hi>Luſtres</hi> or <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiads,</hi> but have one perpetual <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> a never ending <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee.</hi>

               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:61462:103"/>7. The Arithmeticians are ſo bold as to tell you, they can ſet down how many Corns of Duſt make up the Globe of the Earth. They will go a ſtrain beyond that, and ſay they can give a number to as many Grains, as ſhall fill the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Concavity betwixt this and the Firmament. The Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians take the height and dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the remoteſt Planet, put a Girdle about the Heaven it ſelf. The Philoſophers will tell you of what ſtuff the Stars and Spheres are made. It would not only poſe <hi>Archimedes,</hi> but baffle the Angels themſelves, to draw imaginary Lines about the higheſt Heaven, ſumm up the Calends of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Here you have a Picture with a <hi>Janus</hi> Face; on the one ſide the Features ſhadowed with a black Coal, a blubber'd Face, diſhelved Hairs; but he that makes a curious
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61462:104"/>inſpection ſhall find, though black, yet ſhe's comly, diſcover a life in that ſorrow, beauty in that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs. On the other ſide, there are only ſome few Lines drawn to ſhew, that ſomething more excellent ſhould there be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed. <hi>Zeuxis</hi> being hopeleſs of pourtraicting a comly <hi>Venus,</hi> limn'd only the back parts, leaving the reſt to fancy and imagination. At beſt, we can draw but in Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colours thoſe incomprehenſible Glories. For if <hi>Paul,</hi> a Star of the firſt Magnitude, after he had been caught up into Heaven, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſplendid Equipage of that place, confeſſed that he ſaw things unexpreſſible, and heard things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable, 'tis not for Duſt and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes to bedribble with a rude Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſuch ſuperexcellent perfections.

For if we ſuffer with him we ſhall alſo reign with him. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved his Uncle <hi>Laban</hi> ſeven years for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and they ſeemed but as a few days, for the love he bare to her. If we deſire the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſals of Eternity, we muſt cheerfully undergo a few Medicinal Corrections, feed upon Husks, ſince
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61462:105"/>it brings us to the fatted Calf.
